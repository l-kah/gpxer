# gpxer - view gpx-files
Webapp based on ionic/angularjs/cordova
Just for learning purposes ...

The app currently uses internal gpx-files (www/gpx-data).
Next thing to implement are external/sd-access and google drive.

The ionic-components are mostly stripped away and replaced by angular-directives
and custom-stylesheets based on Google material design.
